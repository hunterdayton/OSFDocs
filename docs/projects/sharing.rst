**Purpose:** Sharing allows users to share public projects on social media sites. These include Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and email.

A "Share" button appears on the top right of every public project and registration. to the right of the "Duplicate" button. The "Share" button also appears on the top right of public file views, to the left of the "Download" button. This button appears for all public projects regardless of the project owner and permission level. 

Selecting the "Share" button from the project or registration overview page reveals icons for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and email. Hovering over the LinkedIn icon causes a notice to appear stating::

	"Disable adblock for full sharing functionality"

Selecting an icon will cause a new window with the selected sharing application to appear. If the user is not logged into that service, they are prompted to log in and post the provided link. Users already logged in may post immediately with the option to write a description and control who the post will be shared with. 

Selecting the "Share" button from the file view page displays a pop-up modal with two tabs. The first, labeled "Share", includes the social media icons below a link to the rendered file. This may be copied by selecting the copy icon to the left of the link. The second tab, labeled "Embed", includes two fields::

	"Dynamically render iframe with JaveScript"
	[JavaScript file link]
	"Direct iframe with fixed height and width"
	[file link with dimensions]

Both links are editable within the modal.
