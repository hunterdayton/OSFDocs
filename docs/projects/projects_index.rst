Projects
===============
**Purpose:** A project is the fundamental means of organization and content sharing on the OSF.

To store or share any documents or other content on the OSF, a user must create a project. :ref:`Project creation <quick-tasks>`
can be done from the "My Dashboard" page. Users can find their own projects and navigate to them via their :ref:`Project Organizer <organizer>`
and can discover public projects through the :ref:`search function <search>`.

Projects can be nested within one another, creating a tree structure. Users can create the structure of their choice by creating
projects and components and organizing them within one another.
